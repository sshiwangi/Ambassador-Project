## Problem Research
The problem of providing clothes to people in need was chosen as a focus for solving due to several compelling reasons. 

- Firstly, there are countless vulnerable children worldwide who lack access to proper clothing. Concurrently, there are many individuals who possess an abundance of clothes they no longer wear for various reasons, such as outgrowing them or changing fashion preferences. Thus, creating a platform that facilitates the donation of clothes from willing individuals to NGOs dedicated to collecting and distributing them seemed like a practical and impactful solution.

- By establishing a platform for clothing donations, the aim is to connect those who wish to donate their clothes with reputable NGOs that specialize in distributing them to individuals in need. This arrangement not only benefits the recipients, as they receive essential clothing items, but also provides a means for donors to contribute positively to their communities. The act of donating clothes can be emotionally fulfilling for donors, as they witness firsthand the positive impact they can have on someone's life, potentially brightening their day and instilling a sense of hope.

- By utilizing a dedicated platform for clothing donations, it becomes easier for individuals to find avenues to donate their unused or unwanted clothes. This centralized system ensures that the donated items are channeled efficiently to trusted NGOs, eliminating the hassle of finding suitable organizations to donate to and promoting transparency in the donation process.
